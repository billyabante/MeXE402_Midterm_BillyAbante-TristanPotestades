# Linear Regression

### Introduction

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This project aims to predict the number of daily and hourly bike rentals (dependent variable) based on various factors influencing rental counts (independent variables) using linear regression.  

### Dataset Description

The Bike Sharing Dataset contains information about daily bike rentals in a specific region. It includes features like weather conditions, date information, and seasonal factors that might influence the number of bike rentals.
Project Objectives

    1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, identifying and treating outliers, and potentially normalizing features (if necessary).
    2. Model Implementation: Build a linear regression model using the Scikit-learn library in Python to predict daily bike rentals.
    3. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    4. Interpretation: Analyze the model coefficients to understand the significance of each independent variable and the overall predictive power of the model.

### Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

    Import Libraries: Necessary libraries like pandas and scikit-learn will be imported for data manipulation and modeling.
    Load Data: Load the bike-sharing dataset using pandas.
    Explore Data: Analyze basic statistics of the data to understand its characteristics.
    Handle Missing Values: Identify and address missing values using techniques like imputation or deletion (based on reasons for missingness).
    Identify Outliers: Investigate potential outliers and decide on appropriate treatment methods (e.g., capping, winsorization).
    Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones if it improves the model (optional).
    Normalization (optional): If necessary, normalize features to have a similar scale to prevent biases towards features with larger values.

2. Model Implementation

    Split Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to build the model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
    Define Model: Create a linear regression model instance using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
    Train Model: Fit the model on the training data.
    Predict: Use the trained model to predict bike rentals on the testing data.

3. Evaluation Metrics

    R-squared: Calculate R-squared to assess how well the model explains the variance in the actual bike rentals.
    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Calculate MSE to measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual bike rentals.
    Additional Metrics (optional): Consider using other metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) depending on the problem context.

4. Interpretation

    Analyze Coefficients: Examine the coefficients of the independent variables in the model. The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship with the dependent variable (positive or negative). The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the relative strength of the relationship.
    Model Performance: Based on the evaluation metrics, assess the model's ability to predict bike rentals. Analyze if the model generalizes well to unseen data and achieves a reasonable level of accuracy.

### Documentation

    Code Comments: The Python code will be well-commented to explain each step of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
    Methodology: This document provides a detailed overview of the methodology used throughout the analysis.

### Results

    The analysis process, including data cleaning and feature engineering steps, will be documented.
    The performance metrics (R-squared, MSE, etc.) obtained from the linear regression model will be presented.
    Coefficients of the independent variables and their interpretation will be discussed.

### Discussion

    Reflect on the results and the limitations of the model.
    Discuss the significance of the features in predicting bike rentals.
    Consider comparing the performance of linear regression with other potential models for this problem (e.g., decision trees, random forest).
